    <p> 
        I spend a lot of my free time to my hobbies, which are not just activities for fun but also personal expressions of who I am. I like to watch movies, listen to music, and keep a journal to express myself by printing random photos from various moments i've had, playing video games on my phone or computer, and participating in gaming competitions; they allow me to express myself and spark my imagination. On days when i need to get my mind off some things, i often dance, go for a walk outdoors with my dog, or just go for a swim. These hobbies balance my life, giving me both joy and peace of mind.
Aside from my personal interests, i deeply value the people around me. My family and friends play a big role in shaping who i am today, i have been always used to being alone or just prefer to be alone but they showed me that i am not always alone that i can always rely on them when things get hard. They are my source of support, inspiration, and motivation. I enjoy spending quality time with them, whether it is through simple hang outs, conversations, shared laughter, or helping one another in difficult times. I believe that relationships we build are some of the most important treasures i had in my life.
